# Hartford Traffic Stops

This document consists of two graphs showing interesting insights into the police traffic stops in Hartford, CT, drawing upon data from the Stanford Open Policing Project. The first depicts the frequency of traffic stops at a given time throughout the day and shows that traffic stops occur at, or at least are reported at, times in intervals of five minutes (12:00, 12:05, etc.) far more frequently than they do at other exact times. The second shows the ratio of black to white arrests in each of the city's neighborhoods. It shows that, while there are more neighborhoods for which the black arrest rate is higher than that for white people, the numbers are roughly equivalent. It also shows, however, that in Downtown and other areas with more concentrated police stops, black people are arrested at higher rates.
